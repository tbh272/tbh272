## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm **TBH**, a passionate developer from the **USA**, currently crafting code in the wilds of **Wyoming** 🌄. I’m all about creating immersive experiences with **Unreal Engine** and **Godot**, and I’m always tinkering with new ideas to bring games to life.

- 🔭 **Currently working as**: An Unreal Engine and Godot Developer, building worlds one node at a time.
- 📚 **Learning journey**: Diving deep into **Git** (yep, it’s a wild ride!) and exploring advanced game dev techniques.
- ⚡ **When I’m not coding**: You’ll find me drinking **chai**, brainstorming game mechanics.
- 💬 **Fun fact**: I believe creating free templates for people to use is better than 20+ videos!

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

Here’s what I bring to the table:

- **Game Development**: Unreal Engine (mainly Blueprints), Godot
- **Programming**: C++, GDScript, C#, and java (from college)
- **Version Control**: Git (Still learning! yikes!!!)
- **Other Tools**: Blender (terrible at it tbh), Accurig/Mixamo for easy 3D rigs
- **Soft Skills**: Problem-solving, debugging, quick rewrites/fixes

## 🚀 Projects

Here are a few things I’ve been working on:

- **3D Platformer (Godot)**: A dynamic platformer with advanced movement mechanics like sprinting, dashing, and a state-machine-driven character controller. Check it out for smooth jumps and flashy animations! 🏃‍♂️
- **2.5D Platformer (Godot)**: A template to combine 2D tools to 3D space using godot's already built in Sprite3D nodes (ex. AnimatedSprite3D).
- **2.5D Platformer (UE5)**: A template to bring 2D and the powerhouse of UE5 together using PaperZD, I wont be working on this much, but it should have everything you need to get started.

> Want to collaborate or remix my projects? Feel free to fork them and make them your own! 🚧

## 🌟 Why I Code

Game development is my hobby away from work. While I want to start a career in this field, and be one of the cool people in big projects, I also know that high level stress comes along with it especially if your making a game with an open world. I might love the challenge, not the burnout as we can probably all agree on.
