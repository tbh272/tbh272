UE5 Developer - Making Free to Use Templates
--------------------------------------------

Just like most I learned through unity with youtube as my main teacher, then found Unreal Engine 4 and fell in love with C++/Blueprints. After some years in college I wanted to help other developers with creating templates that hopefully is barebones to the point you can change virtually anything without long documentation pages, and worried that if you change one asset it would mess up 3-4 others.
